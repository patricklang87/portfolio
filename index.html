            <p>I began teaching myself how to code in June 2020.</p>
            <p>This is my digital portfolio, designed to keep track of projects I develop as I practice programming.</p>
            <p>I began by practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript and have gradually spent more time practicing Python as well, primarily motivated through my interest in its potential for Natural Language Processing.</p>
            <p>None of the projects are polished, final versions. They are sketches, generally begun and interrupted as I discovered new tools available to me.</p>
            <p>I work as a college-level instructor of German and Russian. Inspired by our online course management tool, Sakai, and its auto-graded testing functions, I am gradually working toward the ability to create auto-graded testing functions customized more specifically to my goals.</p>
